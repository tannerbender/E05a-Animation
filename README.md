# E05a-Animation

Within this file there 2 games that are opened and played almost exactly the same. In one game you are able to move the mouse around on the screen and watch it change locations. Within the coding of that file there are several functions defined that allow the user to use the mouse and change the position of the ball. In the other file, "main2.py" it is the same game. However, instead of being able to control the ball with the mouse, you move the ball with the arrow keys on the keyboard. Within that file there are several functions that don't allow the user to use the mouse but define functions that allow you to use the keys.
